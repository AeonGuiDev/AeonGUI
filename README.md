Aeon Gui for Aeon simplewallet
This project is contrib from community and is not an official release from AEON.
It will relay on python as main language. There will be a "middle man" to interact with ./simplewallet since RPC calls make it difficult to interact directly with daemon.
More news will be posted soon, this project will start as soon as next year.
